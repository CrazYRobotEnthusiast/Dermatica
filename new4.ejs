          message =`## Melanoma: Overview & Symptoms

Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, but it's also the least common. It arises from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. Early detection and treatment are crucial because advanced melanoma can spread to other organs and become life-threatening.

Overview:

Cause: Primarily caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds.
Risk factors: Fair skin, multiple moles, history of sunburns, family history of melanoma.
Symptoms: Often appear as changes in existing moles or new skin growths.

Symptoms:

Remember the "ABCDE" rule to help identify potential melanomas:

A - Asymmetry: One half of the mole or lesion doesn't match the other.
B - Border: The edges are irregular, ragged, or blurred.
C - Color: Uneven color with shades of brown, black, tan, red, blue, or white.
D - Diameter: Larger than 6 millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser).
E - Evolving: Changes in size, shape, color, or elevation over time.

Other possible signs:

* A sore that doesn't heal.
* Bleeding or oozing from a mole or lesion.
* Itching or tenderness around a mole or lesion.
* A new mole that looks different from your others (the "ugly duckling" sign).

It's important to remember:

* Not all melanomas follow the ABCDE rule, so any unusual changes in your skin warrant a doctor's visit.
* Early detection and treatment significantly improve the chances of successful treatment.
* Regular skin checks by a dermatologist are crucial, especially for individuals with high risk factors.

          message = `Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. It is not contagious and can affect people of all ages, though it often starts in childhood. While there is no cure for eczema, there are ways to manage the symptoms and prevent flare-ups.

Symptoms of eczema:

Dry, itchy skin: This is the most common symptom of eczema and can be severe. Scratching can worsen the itching and lead to infection.

Red, inflamed skin: The affected areas of skin may be red, inflamed, and swollen.

Blisters: Small, fluid-filled blisters may form on the skin. These blisters can break open and weep clear fluid.

Cracked, bleeding skin: Scratching and rubbing can damage the skin, leading to cracking and bleeding.

Thickened skin: Over time, the skin may become thickened and leathery.

Scaly patches: The affected areas of skin may be covered in scales.

Overview of eczema:
The exact cause of eczema is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with eczema often have a family history of allergies or other atopic conditions, such as asthma or hay fever.

Triggers of eczema flare-ups:
Dry skin: Dry, cold weather can worsen eczema symptoms.
Irritants: Soaps, detergents, and other harsh chemicals can irritate the skin and trigger a flare-up.
Allergens: Dust mites, pet dander, pollen, and food allergies can trigger flare-ups in some people.
Stress: Stress can worsen eczema symptoms.

Treatment for eczema:
There is no cure for eczema, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms and prevent flare-ups. These treatments may include:
Moisturizers: Regular use of a moisturizer can help keep the skin hydrated and prevent flare-ups.
Corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are medications that can help reduce inflammation and itching.
Immunomodulators: These medications help regulate the immune system and can be used for moderate to severe eczema.
Light therapy: Ultraviolet light therapy can help reduce inflammation and itching.
 Dupilumab: This is a biologic medication that is injected and can help control moderate to severe eczema.

If you have eczema, it is important to see a doctor or dermatologist to get a diagnosis and discuss treatment options.

        case "Melanocytic Nevi (NV)":
          message = `## Melanocytic Nevi (NV): Overview & Symptoms

Melanocytic nevi, also commonly known as moles, are growths on the skin made up of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment. Most nevi are harmless and pose no health risk. However, it's important to be able to recognize them and monitor them for any changes, as some might develop into melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.

Overview:

Common: Up to 40 moles per person are considered normal.
Appearance: Vary in size , shape, and color (brown, black, tan, pink). Can be flat, raised, hairy, or smooth.
Cause: Usually unknown, but genetics and sun exposure play a role.
Types: Several types exist, including congenital nevi (present at birth), junctional nevi (flat and pigmented), compound nevi (raised with pigment), and dysplastic nevi (atypical appearance).

Symptoms:

Most moles are harmless and require no specific symptoms to watch for. However, it's crucial to monitor any mole for changes, which can be early signs of melanoma. Be aware of the ABCDE rule:

A: Asymmetry - One half doesn't match the other.
B: Border - Irregular, ragged, or blurred edges.
C: Color - Uneven with shades of brown, black, tan, red, blue, or white.
D: Diameter - Larger than 6 millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser).
E: Evolving - Changes in size, shape, color, or elevation over time.

Other warning signs:

* Itching, bleeding, or oozing from a mole.
* New mole that looks different from your others (the "ugly duckling" sign).
* Sore that doesn't heal around a mole.

It's important to remember:

* Not all moles that change are cancerous, but it's best to consult a doctor for any suspicious changes.
* Regular skin self-exams and professional skin checks by a dermatologist are crucial for early detection of melanoma.
* Sun protection is vital to prevent new nevi and reduce the risk of melanoma.

 Early detection and treatment are key to managing moles and preventing melanoma. Don't hesitate to seek professional advice if you have any concerns about your moles.

        case "Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)":
          message = `## Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL): Overview & Symptoms

Benign keratosis-like lesions (BKL) are a term used to describe a group of non-cancerous skin growths resembling seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses, or other benign keratoses. However, BKLs have distinct characteristics that differentiate them from these typical keratoses, making them a category of their own.

Overview:

Cause: Unknown, but may be linked to sun exposure, age, and genetic factors.
Prevalence: More common in older adults, particularly those with fair skin.
Appearance: Vary depending on the specific type of BKL but generally share some similarities with classic keratoses:
    * Flat or slightly raised.
    * Round or oval shaped.
    * Smooth or slightly rough surface.
    * Varying colors such as brown, black, tan, or pink.
    * Typically less than 1 cm in diameter.
Types: Several types exist, some with distinct features:
    * Porokeratosis Mibelli (PM): Waxy, white, or yellowish lesions commonly affecting the legs.
    * Kyrle disease: Symmetrical lesions found on the extremities and trunk.
    * Stucco keratosis: Thickened, hyperkeratotic plaques on the extremities.
    * Follicular keratosis: Rough, bump-like lesions usually seen on the upper arms and thighs.

Symptoms:

BKLs are typically asymptomatic, meaning they don't cause any pain, itching, or other noticeable symptoms. However, some individuals might experience mild irritation or discomfort depending on the location and size of the lesions.

Diagnosis:

Diagnosis of BKLs relies on a dermatological examination followed by a biopsy for confirmation. The biopsy helps rule out other types of skin lesions, including potentially cancerous ones.

Treatment:

BKLs generally don't require treatment as they are benign. However, some individuals might opt for cosmetic removal for aesthetic reasons or if the lesions cause discomfort. Removal options include:

Cryotherapy: Freezing the lesion with liquid nitrogen.
Curettage: Scraping the lesion with a surgical instrument.
Laser therapy: Using lasers to vaporize the lesion.

Important Points:

* BKLs are non-cancerous but require proper diagnosis to differentiate them from other skin lesions.
* They typically cause no symptoms but can be removed for cosmetic reasons.
* If you notice any suspicious skin growths, consult a dermatologist for proper evaluation.
